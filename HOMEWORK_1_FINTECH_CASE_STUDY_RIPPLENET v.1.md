## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Ripple Lab Inc. 

* When was the company incorporated?

Company has been established in 2012 under the name OpenCoin. 
In 2015 the company changed its name to Ripple Lab Inc.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Co-founders of the corporation are Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founders of the company noticed that outdated global payment infrastructure does not correspond with current market demand.
Current demand is seamless, real-time, certain and cost effective transaction. 
Internet of value is the concept they referred to, and the original idea is to enable financial institutions to send money 
worldwide via blockchain based solution: **_instantly, reliably and with low cost_**. 

However, Ripple became real time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Ripple is privately funded company. Over the years they had 13 rounds of financing and raised overall $121.6M.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

Inefficient cross-border payment market is the biggest issue of the last decade due to a complex operations and a lot of correspondent banks in the clearing process and lack of transparency in terms of fees. Real time gross settlement in international payments is the biggest FinTech challenge and a lot of companies fight for share of the wallet. 
RippleNet blockchain based technology offered a solution to solve this issue and execute transactions in real time.

For the last, almost five decades international payments are done via SWIFT network.

**SWIFT** stands for Society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and it is worldwide accepted network for cross-border communications, payments and settlement, with over 11000+ banks in the system in over 200 countries. 

"SWIFT" is a global member-owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services. 
"We provide our community with a platform for messaging and standards for communicating, and we offer products and services to facilitate access and integration, identification, analysis and financial crime compliance" is stated on their profile. 
Business Identifier Codes (BICs) are popularly known as "SWIFT codes" and they are used for communication among the members.

New technologies are evolving in the last couple of years and cross border payments are on the cross-road. SWIFT challenged by Ripple's solution decided to upgrade its network by development and marketing of GPI (global payment innovation) solution in 2017. Same-day cross-border transfers, transparent fees, and payment tracking are its core value. By the end of 2018, 3500 banks joined SWIFT GPI and executed $300B in daily value of transactions in 148 currencies which represents 85% of SWIFT messaging traffic. 

40% of those payments where credited to final beneficiaries within 5 minutes and almost all others within the next 24 hours.

* Who is the company's intended customers?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Ripple Lab Inc. divided the RippleNet users in two categories:


  1.  network users - Corporates, SMEs, Small Banks and payment providers who only send payments
2.  network members - Banks, Payment providers as they process payment and source liquidity

Cross-border payments are concentrated in B2B activities. Overall market value of global international payments is around $ 150 trillion, including but not limited to payments initiated by treasury for inter-corporate and intra-corporate lending, investment, liquidity flows.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ripple Lab Inc. is the only blockchain company today with products worldwide accepted. Ripple's payment network include more than 300 customers within more than 40 countries in six continents.

Ripple offers blockchain based solution to solve this problem and has several products in its portfolio: 

***_xRapid_** - transfer cross border remittance

***_xCurrent_** - enable banks instant end-to-end tracking cross-border payment settlement (global real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system)

***_xVia_** - standard payment interface

***_ODL (On-demand Liquidity)_** is added to products portfolio as of 2018 with clear goal to leverage their own digital asset XRP. XRP is used as a bridge currency to eliminate the need for pre-funding in cross border payments. Within a year they have a 20+ new clients and made 7x more transactions. 

Financial institutions in Ripple's network enjoy faster, lower-cost global payments, and by utilization of digital asset XRP have access to source of liquidity, available within seconds. 
Ripple's digital currency XRP is specially designed payment token, quick, affordable and more scalable than competitors.

Ripple Lab Inc. present its company as a game changer in the payment industry, as they are changing the financial system from within, actively collaborating with central banks, financial institutions, regulators and governments toward mutual goal, improving the way to move the funds.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Technology behind the Ripple is  XRP Ledger written in C++. It is decentralized cryptographic ledger powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. The XRP ledger has been created in 2012 with finite supply of 100B. 80% of those XRPs were donated to the company to develop XRP ledger and its ecosystem. In Ripples idea to build Internet of Value,  company utilize XRP to create the world where money will move efficiently as information does. The server software  that powers the ledger is called _rippled_ and is available on Ripple github repository under ISC open-source license.

Key feature of the XRP ledger:

    

**Censorship-Resistant Transaction Processing:** No single party decides which transactions succeed or fail, and no one can "roll back" a transaction after it completes. As long as those who choose to participate in the network keep it healthy, they can settle transactions in seconds.
    
**Fast, Efficient Consensus Algorithm:** The XRP Ledger's consensus algorithm settles transactions in 4 to 5 seconds, processing at a throughput of up to 1500 transactions per second. These properties put XRP at least an order of magnitude ahead of other top digital assets.

**Finite XRP Supply:** When the XRP Ledger began, 100 billion XRP were created, and no more XRP will ever be created. The available supply of XRP decreases slowly over time as small amounts are destroyed to pay transaction costs.
    
**Responsible Software Governance:** A team of full-time, world-class developers at Ripple maintain and continually improve the XRP Ledger's underlying software with contributions from the open-source community. Ripple acts as a steward for the technology and an advocate for its interests, and builds constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions worldwide.
    
**Secure, Adaptable Cryptography:** The XRP Ledger relies on industry standard digital signature systems like ECDSA (the same scheme used by Bitcoin) but also supports modern, efficient algorithms like Ed25519. The extensible nature of the XRP Ledger's software makes it possible to add and disable algorithms as the state of the art in cryptography advances.
    
**Modern Features for Smart Contracts:** Features like Escrow, Checks, and Payment Channels support cutting-edge financial applications including the Interledger Protocol. This toolbox of advanced features comes with safety features like a process for amending the network and separate checks against invariant constraints.
    
**On-Ledger Decentralized Exchange:** In addition to all the features that make XRP useful on its own, the XRP Ledger also has a fully-functional accounting system for tracking and trading obligations denominated in any way users want, and an exchange built into the protocol. The XRP Ledger can settle long, cross-currency payment paths and exchanges of multiple currencies in atomic transactions, bridging gaps of trust with XRP.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Ripple Lab Inc. activities are originally in blockchain and cryptocurrency domain but they are solving payment and billing issue and value transfer. 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Cross- border payments are on the cross-road. Development of international trade, e-commerce, internationalization of production imply that cross border payment will continue to grow. SWift platform have been used for decades and dominated the world payment domain.
The payment process was slow, inefficient, not transparent and costly, as one never knows the final price of transaction due to lot of 
intermediaries.

In the last ten years with widely accepted online and mobile payments,  blockchain and cryptocurrencies development user expectations rise toward better, faster service, convenience, security and low cost.

"Safe and efficient cross-border payments are vital for growth and financial inclusion. The emergence and use of cryptocurrencies across 
borders signals to central bankers that our current payment systems are too expensive and slow. Action is needed to put better arrangements in place," according to Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) Chairman Benoît Coeuré. 

CPMI is part of Bank for International Settlement, an institution governed by major central banks, including US FED.

As new companies entered the market, especially Ripple, SWIFT as monopoly reacted and developed new service SWIFT GPI (global payment innovation)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

There are a lot of companies in blockchain domain who tried to revolutionize money transfer and payments worldwide. Among others these are from my point of view the most interesting ones: 

  *  **SWiFT** GPI (Global Payment Innovation)  is a global member owned cooperative and the world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services. 

 * **Western Union** is a worldwide financial services and communications company, present in over 200 countries.
 
 * **GEO protocol** is an open-source protocol for cost-efficient, lightweight and scalable value transfer, merging blockchain and traditional finance worlds together.
 
* **IBMs BWW** (Blocskchain World Wire) based on Stellar blockchain. Blockchain World Wire, is the new solution that simultaneously clears and settles cross-border payments.

 * **ABRA** - peer to peer platform that enable users to transfer digital currencies to other user. Available in SEPA and EU area in more than 70 fiat and crypto currencies.
 
 * **Stellar** - blockchain payment platform that is trying to fight poverty by connecting low cost financial institutions and their customers.  Real time settlement (in 2-5 seconds), lower remittance costs, mobile banking and an automatic currency exchange are some of the Stellar network features.
 
    Indeed, there are a lot of participants in cross-border payments:

    ## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

 Ripple business impact on payment industry is already noticed and becoming significant. Over a period of five years Ripple announced that they managed to get on board over 300+ financial institutions worldwide to enable faster, lower-cost payments across 40 countries and six continents. 
 Money remittance and settlement in real time is a huge step forward in payment industry. As an example of Ripple success story is Ripple cooperation with payment provider from India TransferGo. TransferGo  announced that the company is using Ripple’s RippleNet payment platform to launch a remittance corridor to India. With Ripple’s platform, TransferGo is hoping to speed up its Europe-to-India payment processing from 2 to 3 days to just a few seconds.

Also,  Ripple's market activities make SWIFT to responded with Global Payment Innovation as upgrade of SWIFT protocol. Comparison of two 
solutions shows the advantages of blockchain technology over swift messaging protocol:

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

In the digital era and fast technology development some of the core metrics that should have been considered in modern cross-border payment industry are:
1.  Transaction speed, 
2. Transparency and Security 
3. Cost-efficiency
    
  
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Ripple as a challenger on the remittance market have tremendous success and disrupted the monopoly of SWIFT. Transaction speed of RippleNet - real time settlement -up to 5 seconds vs. Swift GPI - intra-day payments (from 5 min to 24 hrs).  
Also, as it is build on blockchain the whole process is fully transparent and costs are predictable. 

In SWIFT, cross-border payments go through the correspondent banking system, facilitated by SWIFT messages like MT101 and ISO 20022 payment instruction (pain, camt). 

There are couple of participants involved in the process – payer, payer’s bank, payer’s bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank, beneficiary. So, it was almost imposible to assess the costs of transactions, and there were chargebacks. 

With  upgraded service SWIFT GPI  as of 2017 following service becomes new standard: same day credit of funds, up front pricing and payment tracking, but still no real time settlement for transactions.



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

After the initial success and already significant number of financial institutions in their network, I would recommend to Ripple to  develop blockchain based trade finance solution.

As a technology provider and also liquidity provider Ripple could be play significant role.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

As Ripple is solving cross-border payments problem, trade finance is logical step forward as documentary business should also be much faster, transparent and cheaper. 

International trade is developing on very fast pace and according to the study of FCI (Global Representative Body for Factoring and Financing of Open Account Domestic and International Trade Receivables) there is untapped market with huge potential. 

Early entrants, according to my opinion Ripple could be one.  could disrupt this market niche and open new race with SWIFT as currently their protocol is used also for trade finance.
